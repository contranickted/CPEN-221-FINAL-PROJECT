Problem:
Have you ever felt like you were drowning in work? Or that you had no time to attend events? Time management is a prominent problem among students, employers, and professors. Juggling course workload, late-night studies for exams, and social life isn't easy for anyone. Sometimes we have a hard time navigating work-life balance. The inability to manage time effectively has far-reaching consequences, missed deadlines cause increased stress and constantly feeling behind can lead to burnout. Furthermore, quality of work suffers when tasks are rushed, and personal relationships with others can deteriorate.

By tackling the root causes and providing practical, tailored solutions, we aim to alleviate the time management challenges faced by students, employers, and professors, ultimately leading to enhanced productivity, well-being, and success.
